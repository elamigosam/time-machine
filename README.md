A description of what I think would be a time machine engine??

Somewhere I heard that in order to manipulate time you have to travel faster than light.  Also that if you grab a string from one end and spin it, it creates a circle.  Inside this spining circle, the center travels slower and the edge travels faster than the center.  Similar to how here on the ground we stand still, but out in space, the space station in order to stay still, it travels at around 4.76 miles/s.  So with this information in mind, we can create a experiment where we blast a laser beam (that travels at the speed of light) and somehow (keyword) we make it travel in a circle.  <br/>
